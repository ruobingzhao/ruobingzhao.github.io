<!--A charged nucleus in the central field generates a Coulomb potential field, and a point mass rotates around the nucleus under electrostatic force. The Schr&oumldinger equation is converted to dequantized form, and an approximation of the solution as series expansion is obtained through the use of a complex-valued diffusion representation. As the radial distance to the center of the field approaches infinity, the solution approaches to that of a free particle. Probability density functions associated with the quadratic and cubic terms from the series are shown in the figure below.-->
