Highlights of Reviews from my students:
</h1>
<p>
  "Good TA! She was always very nice and prompt when asked questions. She also responded to emails well. I think what i like most is how she typed up all her notes from problem sessions, and is an example of her going above and beyond for the benefit of us students!" "She is great at clearly explaining the topics being covered, and answering questions." "She really helped with the homeworks and to clearly explain concepts that I was having trouble with." "smart" "Super helpful! Super smart!" "Very patient" "Very willing to help students succeed through homework and exam preparation." "Whenever we needed her, she was always helpful." "Ruobing is an awesome TA! I strongly recommend going to her office hours." "AWESOME at explain homework problems." "Was able to work through questions to answer them in an effective manner." "Ruobing has kindly helped me a lot during this quarter! Her instructions are so much useful! Thanks so much" "She's one of my favorite TA's I've had at UCSD! She made the material easier to understand and explained concepts nicely when I had questions." "You can miss the lecture, but cannot miss her TA session" "Making subject lucid."
