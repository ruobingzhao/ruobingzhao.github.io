<h1>Classical Music Appreciation For Beginners</h1>
<p>By classical music I mean "precise music", which includes music from the Baroque era, the classical era, the romantic era, the impressionist era, etc. It's easier to appreciate a piece if you know the meaning/story/picture connected to it. Here are some examples. </p>

<p>Beethoven: Piano Sonata No.17 in D Minor "Tempest"</p>

<p>Debussy: La Neige Danse, from "Children's Corner"</p>

<p>Chopin: Piano Sonata No.2 in B-Flat Minor, 3rd Movement "Marche Fun&egrave bre"
