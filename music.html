<h1>Classical Music Appreciation For Beginners</h1>
<p>I studied piano from age 6-15. Although I haven't had much time to play since, I remain an aficionado of classical music. By classical music I mean "precise music", which includes music from the Baroque era, the classical era, the romantic era, the impressionist era, etc. Do you aspire to be a connoisseur of classical music but get bored or get lost easily? It's easier to appreciate a piece if you know the theme/story/picture connected to it. Here are some examples. </p>
